# SQL Project: Music Store Data Analysis ðŸŽ¶

This project explores an SQL database for a fictional Music Store, analyzing customer behavior, sales patterns, and identifying key business insights. Queries are categorized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Moderate**, and **Advanced**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Outline

The project is organized into **three question sets**:

1. **Easy Questions:** Basic data analysis queries to understand employees, invoices, and top customers.
2. **Moderate Questions:** Intermediate queries exploring customer music preferences, top artists, and song durations.
3. **Advanced Questions:** Complex queries providing detailed insights into customer spending, genre popularity, and customer behavior across countries.

## ðŸ“„ Database Requirements

To run these SQL queries, a relational database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server) with tables for `employee`, `customer`, `invoice`, `invoice_line`, `track`, `album`, `artist`, and `genre` is needed. Each table contains data for employees, customers, invoices, tracks, and other related information for the Music Store.
