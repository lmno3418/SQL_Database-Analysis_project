<h1>SQL Project: Music Store Data Analysis ðŸŽ¶</h1>
<p>This project explores an SQL database for a fictional Music Store, analyzing customer behavior, sales patterns, and identifying key business insights. Queries are categorized by difficulty: <strong>Easy</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Advanced</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>ðŸ“Š Project Outline</h2>
<p>The project is organized into <strong>three question sets</strong>:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Easy Questions:</strong> Basic data analysis queries to understand employees, invoices, and top customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderate Questions:</strong> Intermediate queries exploring customer music preferences, top artists, and song durations.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Questions:</strong> Complex queries providing detailed insights into customer spending, genre popularity, and customer behavior across countries.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ðŸ“„ Database Requirements</h2>
<p>To run these SQL queries, a relational database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server) with tables for <code>employee</code>, <code>customer</code>, <code>invoice</code>, <code>invoice_line</code>, <code>track</code>, <code>album</code>, <code>artist</code>, and <code>genre</code> is needed. Each table contains data for employees, customers, invoices, tracks, and other related information for the Music Store.</p>
